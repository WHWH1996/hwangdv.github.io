I'm a Ph.D candidate in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/), advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). Before that, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (Outstanding Graduate) in 2019. 

My research interests include distributed machine learning system, data center networking, and large language models.
